To switch page layouts, change the <code>template</code> variable at the top of your md file.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most basic layout is called <code>generic</code> and will result in a full width page.</li>\n<li>The second layout is <code>overview</code> which will add an overview/ table of contents side bar to your page.</li>\n<li>The third is <code>columns</code>. To use the columns layout, in each place where you would like your markdown content to split into a new column add the text <code>//split//</code>. You can add many columns this way but it will start to look bad so make sure to view your page before commiting.</li>\n<li>The fourth is <code>rows</code>. To use the rows layout, in each place where you would like your markdown content to split into a new row add the text <code>//split//</code>. You can add as many rows as you like but make sure to view your page before commiting.</li>\n<li>The last is <code>grid</code>. To use the grid layout, in each place where you would like your markdown content to split into a new section add the text <code>//split//</code>. You can add as many sections as you like. You will also need to add a global variable called <code>row-length</code> and assign it an <code>int</code>. This will determine how many sections get put into each row of the grid. Make sure to view your page before commiting. (Check out <code>site/resources/team.md</code> for an example)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: When using <code>//split//</code> make sure to have no space below it. Pandoc and jinja do not parse this well. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"Page-Specific-Styling\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Page-Specific-Styling\" aria-label=\"Page Specific Styling permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Page Specific Styling</h1>\n<p>There are some cases in which you may need to add css styling that only applies to your page. This is a feature that is not yet widely used but can come in handy!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To use this feature, in the 'global variables' at the top of your md add a <code>page</code> variable and set it to a string value without spaces that describes your page. Keep in mind, you can reuse the same specific styles with the same name on other pages.</li>\n<li>This essentially wraps your content in an ID called <code>your-string-value-page</code>. (Note the <code>-page</code> gets added on by the parser.)</li>\n<li>Then in the css file (site/static/style.css), find the section labeled PAGE SPECIFIC STYLING and place your css rules here.</li>\n</ul>","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Page Layouts"},{"depth":1,"value":"Page Specific Styling"}],"frontmatter":{"date":"February 25, 2021","slug":"/course-site-features","title":"Styling and Features Documentation","author":["Ezri '22"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/course-site-features"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
