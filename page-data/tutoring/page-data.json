Polling for TA Availability/Interest</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the semester, a Google form is sent out to all returning TAs to poll for general availability (<a href=\"https://forms.gle/nFB2WMwdR4bJyzQX8\">example</a>). The form also asks for TA interest in tutoring so we can allocate tutoring hours to those who want it most. From this Google form, we can establish weekly tutoring times that TAs are able to staff.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Choosing Tutoring Hours</strong></p>\n<p>Tutoring hours can be chosen largely based on TA availability. Tutoring generally occurs in 2-hour weeknight shifts, 2-4 days a week depending on enrollment numbers of 110 (/other Kris-taught courses). Coordinate with Kris and other special teams to try and avoid overlap between Review Sessions and Tutoring. It is also recommended that <strong>tutoring not be open at night when Office Hours is closed</strong>, as this tends to encourage students to ask assignment questions.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Generating a Schedule</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p6mweLNW9uHxm3dpZBoVfW10m9op-Yi1MES2yoLh_30/edit?usp=sharing\">Example schedule &#x26; Hour allocations spreadsheet</a></p>\n<p>In the past, we have generated the schedule manually in Google Sheets based on the Availability Form during the first two weeks of FDOC. Schedules should stay the same throughout the semester, barring one-time or recurring swaps that may come up.</p>\n<p>Priority for tutoring shifts should be given to those who have prior tutoring experience, seniority, or those who expressed great interest. Priority is also given to 10-hour TAs, but it is not uncommon for 5-hour TAs to also staff tutoring.</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is that each TA should still have 2-3 hours per week dedicated to Office Hours after their allocations for special teams are taken into account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Hour Allocations</strong></p>\n<p>As TAs are signed up for shifts, make sure to update hour allocations by messaging Kaki or whoever is in charge of allocations.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Designating Shift Leads</strong></p>\n<p>Shift Leads are in charge of filling out the shift lead form (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaA92NX9OBnpUyqLa0PM3pm5D_8WxP7o8MNWqwCrynNgOeCw/viewform\">example</a>) that asks if any TA was late/absent or if there were particular student concerns. This form helps collect data to better serve students in tutoring. Shift Leads should be those who have at least one semester of prior tutoring experience or be the Tutoring Team leads.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Tutoring-Flow-In-person--Zoom\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Tutoring-Flow-In-person--Zoom\" aria-label=\"Tutoring Flow In person  Zoom permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tutoring Flow (In-person &#x26; Zoom)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"In-person-Tutoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#In-person-Tutoring\" aria-label=\"In person Tutoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>In-person Tutoring</strong></h3>\n<p>In person tutoring occurs in a classroom (usually FB 007) during the scheduled hours. The classroom must be reserved weekly on the UNC CS calendar; Kris can assist with reserving the room, but it should be reserved early in the semester to avoid conflicts with clubs/other classes. There are generally 1-2 tutors per table. Students can come and go as needed; they can attend as individuals or as groups, but ideally there will be one TA per individual/group until tutoring becomes busy enough to have larger groups. When a student arrives, one TA should greet them and offer assistance!</p>\n<p>If tutoring is busy, students can listen to the topics of existing groups and join the group most applicable to their questions. <em>Important note:</em> Sometimes, the Fred Brooks entrance is locked, so students should have directions provided on the website/course.care to the upper SN entrance across from Phillips Hall. If tutoring hours occur on weekends, coordinate with Kris to make sure facilities know to unlock the upper SN access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Virtual-Tutoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Virtual-Tutoring\" aria-label=\"Virtual Tutoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>Virtual Tutoring</strong></h3>\n<p>A tutoring Zoom link should be generated at the beginning of the semester as a recurring meeting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current <code>Security</code> setting is an enabled waiting room.</li>\n<li>Students should not be able to join the meeting before a host has started the meeting.</li>\n<li>All TAs who have a tutoring shift should be assigned the role of <code>Additional Hosts</code>.
